libfprint v0.5.0 with Authentec BSAPI Support
=============================================

This branch provides support for Authentec device like
  Bus 001 Device 003: ID 147e:2020 Upek TouchChip Fingerprint Coprocessor (WBF advanced mode)
using Authentec BSAPI SDK.

It works well on Fedora 18 with a Thinkpad T430.

The upeke2 driver should support this device, but it doesn't work for
me. Next step would be to use the BSAPI driver and wireshark to
understand what is wrong with upeke2.

This driver doesn't fit well with libfprint design and don't support image grabbing.

The freedesktop.org libfprint source code was cloned from http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/
(I don't know why my master branch interfere with https://github.com/anarsoul/libfprint)

The BSAPI driver comes from https://gitorious.org/libfprint/fprint-bsapi-bridge

libfprint
=========

libfprint is part of the fprint project:
http://www.reactivated.net/fprint

libfprint was originally developed as part of an academic project at the
University of Manchester with the aim of hiding differences between different
consumer fingerprint scanners and providing a single uniform API to application
developers. The ultimate goal of the fprint project is to make fingerprint
scanners widely and easily usable under common Linux environments.

The academic university project runs off a codebase maintained separately
from this one, although I try to keep them as similar as possible (I'm not
hiding anything in the academic branch, it's just the open source release
contains some commits excluded from the academic project).

THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER DOES NOT ENDORSE THIS THIS SOFTWARE RELEASE AND
IS IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CODE CONTAINED WITHIN, OR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED
BY USING OR DISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE. Development does not happen on
university computers and the project is not hosted at the university either.

Section 6 of the license states that for compiled works that use this

make this process slightly easier for you by grouping these all in one place:

We include bozorth3 from the US export controlled distribution. We have
determined that it is fine to ship bozorth3 in an open source project,
